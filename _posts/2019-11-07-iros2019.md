IROS2019 in Macau
------


The IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems was held at The Venetian Macao from November 4 to 8, 2019. Macau is a city famous for its gambling, resorts, and shopping venues, and this was my first expedition into Chinese territory. IROS is one of IEEE's flagship conferences in robotics, so most talks discussed about state-of-the-art results, new systems and innovative applications relevant to intelligent robots. The conference included plenary and keynote talks, technical sessions, workshops and tutorials, forums, pioneersâ€™ talks, and exhibits to enrich fruitful discussions among conference attendees.

For this conference, there were more than 2500 papers submitted from 53 different countries, where 1127 were accepted. The theme of this year was "Robots Connecting People"

I attended this time as a Workshop Organizer. I've been participating as a Jr. Chair of the IEEE RAS [Technical Committee for Robotics Research for Practicality]()https://www.ieee-ras.org/robotics-research-for-practicality. This was our first workshop, where we had different presentations about robots being used in real-life applications, from the medical field to the automobile industry. We had talks from different players in the field, which were very interesting! The turnover was quite good too. You can see the details of the event [here](https://www.ieee-ras.org/robotics-research-for-practicality/activities/338-technical-committees/tc-robotics-research-for-practicality/1407-rrpws-iros-2019).

I also had the opportunity to see a bit around the hotel venue, which was in the center of the strip. It was so full with incredible casinos and structures! I really want to go back to Macau again.

If you go to Macau, don't skip the House of the Dancing Water, and eat as many pineapple cakes as possible!
